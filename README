Blame
=====

1. Description
--------------

Blame displays the last modification for each line in an RCS file. It is the
RCS equivalent of CVS's "annotate" command.

An annotated RCS file describes the revision and date in which each line was
added to the file and the author of each line.

2. Requirements
---------------

To compile Blame you will need a C compiler and standard C library.

Once installed, Blame does not have any external dependencies. It uses its own
RCS parsing code, so it does not itself require RCS.

3. Installation
---------------

In general, the standard

$ ./configure
$ make
  <switch to root>
# make install

will do what you want.

You may wish to run "make check" before switching to root. This will run Blame's
testsuite, which will test many aspects of the program on your system.

4. Usage
--------

A full list of valid command-line options can be viewed using `--help':

$ blame --help

Blame accepts many of the standard RCS options, such as `-r' (to select a
revision):

$ blame -r1.123 myfile

5. Getting Help
---------------

If Blame doesn't compile on your system please send me the config.log file
generated by configure, and a description of which bits don't compile.

If you're having trouble running Blame on certain files you might want to try
the test suite in the tarball. Simply run make check after compilation.

If Blame segfaults and you're feeling adventurous, you can enable full debugging
by using the --enable-debug option in configure. This turns on a bunch of
assertions -- hopefully this will turn the segfault into an identifiable
assertion failure.

If you're still stuck, feel free to mail bug reports to
<foonly@users.sourceforge.net>.
